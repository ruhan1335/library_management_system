# Library Management System (C++)
# Project Overview

This is a simple Library Management System built in C++.
The program allows users to manage a small collection of books through a console-based menu.
 
Users can:
View the list of all available books

Add a new book to the library

Remove an existing book

Exit the program

It is a beginner-friendly project that demonstrates:

Use of vector in C++

Functions and modular programming

Input/Output operations

Basic menu-driven system

# Features
Show Books → Displays all books currently in the library.

Add Book → Lets the user add a new book by name.

Remove Book → Removes a selected book from the list.

Exit → Safely closes the program.

# Technologies Used
Language: C++

Libraries: iostream, vector, string

# How to Run
Copy the code into a file named main.cpp

Compile using any C++ compiler, e.g.:

g++ main.cpp -o library

Run the program:

./library

# Example Usage
=== Library Management System ===
1. Show all books
2. Add a new book
3. Remove a book
4. Exit
Enter your choice (1/2/3/4): 2
Enter the name of the new book: C++ Basics
'C++ Basics' has been added to the library.

# Future Improvements
Add search functionality (find a book by name).

Save book list to a file/database for persistence.

Add categories/authors for each book.

User authentication (Admin/Student roles).
